Introduction
Welcome to the documentation guide for accessing Revive Ad Server. This guide provides clear and concise instructions for configuring a local instance of Revive Ad Server using WampServer and guidance on how to access it for evaluation purposes.
Revive Ad Server is a powerful open-source ad-serving platform that allows publishers to manage and optimise their ad inventory effectively.

2.	Downloaded WampServer Zip Folder:
•	Ensure that the WampServer zip folder from the provided GitHub repository has been successfully downloaded to the local machine. It is called wamp64 on the repository.


3.	Extraction Location:
•	Decide on the directory where the wamp64 zip folder will be extracted. It is typically recommended that you extract it to a location with sufficient disk space and easy access. (You can extract it directing to C:\)
